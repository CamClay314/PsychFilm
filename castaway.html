        <h2>Psychological Analysis</h2>
        <p>*Cast Away* is a profound exploration of isolation and survival. Tom Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, faces the psychological challenges of being stranded on a deserted island. The film delves into themes of loneliness, the human spirit's resilience, and the importance of connection, as symbolized by his relationship with Wilson, the volleyball.</p>
        <p>The film's minimalist approach, focusing on Chuck's struggle for survival, highlights the psychological toll of isolation. The absence of dialogue and the vastness of the ocean serve to amplify his loneliness, making his eventual rescue all the more poignant.</p>
